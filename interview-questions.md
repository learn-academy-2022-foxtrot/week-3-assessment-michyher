1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX is usually used when using REACT. JSX is a combination of html and JavaScript. Although I don't know one syntax difference between HTML and JSX, I can tell you that JSX is an extension of JavaScript and HTML is a language itself. 

Researched answer: JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript, it is there for you to be able to describe the objects in React. JSX uses a syntax that may look like HTML but there are some differnces. One of these differences in syntax would be that in HTML, it is common to use the class attribute, but in JSX, since the class keyword can be used in JavaScript, it can not be used in JSX. 

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

Your answer: Yarn is used when testing your code. It is important to test your code so that you know in what direction you are going and if it is the correct one. It is also easier to fix your code when something is wrong because you have already laid out the logic of what you want to do in the test. 

Researched answer: Yarn is a software packaging system that was developed by Facebook in 2016. They made it to be able to use it with JavaScript. The files that are modified when you run yarn are App.css, App.js, App.test.js, and index.js.

3. What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

Your answer: An anonymous function in JavaScript usually has no name associated with it. They're usually not able to be called or accessed after being made since there is no name to call them by. 

Researched answer: Anonymous functions are usually used when you need a value such as a value of a callable parameter. They can accept multiple inputs and return one output. 

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: State values adn props in React have a clear distinction, that being that props are used to communicate from child to child. And state is where you keep the values that belong to the component.

Researched answer: DOM stands for Dodument Object Model and it is a programming interface for web documents. The DOM represents the page and changes display as the code changes.

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div and a span?

Your answer: Both div and span are typed out with open and close carrots. I would love to know more about it. Once I finish researching more on the matter, I will send you what I found out.
